# Fishing Script
 A small experimental fishing script for a flash game on the internet.


This catches fish in the game using pyautogui's image recognition and the python script is activated by a combination using AHK (Auto HotKey)

*This is not to be used for long periods ingame as it is bannable*
*This was made as a self-learning project*
